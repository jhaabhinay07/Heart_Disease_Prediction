# Heart Disease Prediction System

A machine learning project to predict the risk of heart disease using clinical and demographic data.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, balances data, and scales features.
- **Model Training**: Trains models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Boosting techniques.
- **Prediction System**: Implements a function to predict heart disease risk based on user input.

## Steps to Run
1. Install required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.
3. Test predictions using the provided `predict()` function.

## Dataset
Uses `Hearth_Disease.csv` with features like age, gender, cholesterol, smoking, and more. Target variable: `TenYearCHD`.

## Future Scope
- Add a user-friendly web interface.
- Explore more advanced models for better accuracy.
